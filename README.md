# Prime Number Waveform â€¢ Visualizing Prime Gaps up to 1 Billion

This project provides Python scripts and datasets to generate **prime gap waveforms** â€” a novel visual representation of the gaps between consecutive prime numbers. Using the **logarithmic midpoint** between each prime pair and alternating the prime gaps in sign, the result is a striking, continuous waveform with both signal-like structure and emergent patterns.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Does

- Generates coordinate pairs: `x = log10(midpoint of prime pair)`, `y = Â±(prime gap)`
- Produces smooth, high-resolution **waveform plots (PNG + SVG)**
- Supports waveform generation up to **1 billion natural numbers**
- Optionally exports coordinate data to **CSV files** for further analysis

## ðŸ’¡ Why Itâ€™s Useful

- Creates the first known **visual archive of prime gap behavior at this scale**
- Offers a reproducible framework for:
  - Mathematical pattern exploration
  - Educational demonstrations
  - Data-driven signal analysis (without traditional signal tools)
- Can support further research in number theory or AI pattern detection

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
